/* 
	Iup wrapper for Go.

	Documentation of this package is minimal on purpose. The Iup 
	documentation is very good and go-iup strives to maintain a
	one-to-one relation with the C version of Iup. Where go-iup
	differs from the C variant documentation will exist.

	go-iup function names drop the Iup prefix as they are under
	the iup package. go-iup constant names drop the IUP_ prefix
	as they are under the iup package.
